		<h1>Our Technology</h1>
		<p>Spring Lake Elementary is one of the leading elementary schools in tech-
nology integration. Teachers and students use computers and technology 
as a part of their daily curriculum. Each classroom has an average of three
 computers and the school has three labs with 28 computers in each for 
student use and one mini lab with 15 computers. Our SuccessMaker Labs 
are used for a specific software program that allows students in Grades 
1-5  to practice math and reading skills aligned with the Next Generation 
Sunshine State Standards for their grade level. The production lab is used 
by  teachers when they have a  special project they are working on incorp-
orating  technology such as: Web-quests, Digital Storytelling, Podcasts, 
Blogs, Online Research, Excel Spreadsheets, PowerPoint  projects, and 
virtual field trips.  In addition to desktop computers, we have Tungsten E2 
Hand-held computers, Epson BrightLinks, Promethean Activ-Board, Alpha-
