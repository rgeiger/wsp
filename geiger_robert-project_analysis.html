	<h1>Site Intent:</h1>
		<p>The overall objective of this redesign is to bring the site up to date using current semantic code and validation. 
		By doing this, the site will have much improved loading times as well as improved user-ability.  The site will be tested
		using the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards and will meet SEO (search engine optimization) objectives.</p><p>The 
		redesign will have stylistic improvements based on a users ability to find the information they are looking for.  The site
		will use the latest technologies available but also will be cross browser compatible.  The redesign will also include 
		formatting for users of handheld devices such as iPads, iPhones, and more.</p>

	<h1>Competitive Analysis:</h1>
		<p>Because of the use of the parent site k12.fl.us, competitive data can only be measured by each state and even then 
		would be subjective based on population.  With all of the schools listed on the parent site, we will have to use other
		stats to gauge the redesign such as demographics, users already using the parent site, and keywords to attract more 
		users to the site versus the parent site.</p><p>The average load time is under 1 second.
		The time users spend on the parent site are under 4 minutes and they view under 5 pages.   
						
	<h2>Keywords:</h2>
		<ul><h3>On average, 13 percent of users reach the parent website using a search engine.  Utilizing these keywords will help
		users reach our redesign site.</h3>
			<li>School - The number one searched keyword under education.</li>
			<li>Education - The number one searched keyword In Florida under education.</li>
			<li>Elementary Schools, Florida Elementary Schools, Florida Schools, Florida Education, Spring Lake Schools,
